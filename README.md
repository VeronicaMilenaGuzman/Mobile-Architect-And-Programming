The weight-tracking app was designed to help users monitor their weight, set goals, and view progress over time. It aims to make weight management easy and accessible for users. Key features include daily weight entry and history view. The UI was kept simple to ensure easy navigation and user interaction, making the app effective and user-friendly. I used a modular coding approach, developing each feature separately and testing them iteratively. This method ensured that the app was functional and could be easily updated or debugged in the future. I conducted thorough testing, including unit and user tests, to catch and fix any issues. This process was crucial in refining the app, particularly in ensuring the graph worked well on all devices. The goal-setting feature stands out as a key success, demonstrating my ability to create a feature that not only works well but also enhances the user experience by keeping them motivated and on track.
